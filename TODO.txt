Just optimizations:
DONE: 1. Order constraints by the minimum of the domain sizes of the variables present in the constraint.
splits count down from ~2600 to ~1600. runtime from ~12sec to ~7.5sec
Optional:
2. Don't copy stuff as much.
3. Make it iterative, not recursive.

Actual Constraint Satisfaction stuff:
DONE: 1. Tie breaker for Minimum Remaining Values (mrv) Heuristic. Pick variable used in the most constraints. (changed it to the one used in the least constraints)
DONE: 2. Value picking heuristic: pick the value with highest tightness (leads to a more productive constraint propagation)
DONE: 3. Delete constraints that are already satisfied.
Optional:
4. Backjumping. (Keep a dependancy graph, that would tell us exactly wich split along the branch led to a conflict and backjump straight to that split, instead of backtracking just one level up)

TODO: value - the one that is in the (most) smallest related domains
